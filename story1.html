        <h2>Giant Squid Elected Mayor of Coastal Town

</h2>
        <img src="images/coffee.jpg" alt="Coffee">
        <p>IIn a shocking turn of events, Bluffington, a small coastal town, has elected a giant squid named "Squidward" as its new mayor. The 40-foot cephalopod won by a landslide, capturing 87% of the vote after a group of fishermen jokingly nominated him.

</p>
        <p>Squidward's campaign promises, like "More Fish for Everyone" and "24/7 Beach Access," quickly gained traction among residents. "We never thought it would go this far," said Tom Fisher, one of the fishermen behind the nomination.



</p>
        <p>In his acceptance speech, delivered through enthusiastic squirts and tentacle waves from his tank at the town's aquarium, Squidward vowed to bring "a wave of positive change." His first act was to designate the town's pier as a "cephalopod-friendly zone."



</p>
        <p>Critics question Squidward's ability to manage town affairs. "How can a squid understand our budget?" asked former mayor Sally Crabb. Supporters, however, are optimistic. "We've had human mayors for years; maybe it's time for a squid," said local diner owner Mary Cod.


</p>
        <p>As Squidward takes office, Bluffington eagerly anticipates what changes their new eight-armed leader will bring. The first town hall meeting, held underwater, is expected to be a splash.
